 abstract = { We consider the following problem: a team of robots
is deployed in an unknown environment and it has to
collaboratively build a map of the area without a
reliable infrastructure for communication. The
backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph
optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the
robots, from which the map can be easily built. The
first contribution of this paper is a set of
distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization:
rather than sending all sensor data to a remote
sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very
partial and noisy information to reach an agreement
on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be
considered as a distributed implementation of a
two-stage approach that already exists, where we use
the Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi
Over-Relaxation as workhorses to split the
computation among the robots. We also provide
conditions under which the proposed distributed
protocols converge to the solution of the
centralized two-stage approach. As a second
contribution, we extend the proposed distributed
algorithms to work with the object-based map
models. The use of object-based models avoids the
exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point
clouds or RGB-D data) further reducing the
communication burden. Our third contribution is an
extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed
techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo
simulations and field experiments in a military test
facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests
that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed
Gauss–Seidel method) has excellent performance. The
Distributed Gauss–Seidel method requires minimal
information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales
well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a
team of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy
to implement. Our field tests show that the combined
use of our distributed algorithms and object-based
models reduces the communication requirements by
several orders of magnitude and enables distributed
mapping with large teams of robots in real-world
problems. The source code is available for download
