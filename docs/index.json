To address these challenges, we bring context, the semantic meaning into the robot perception. Our approach is to conduct research on our full-scale testing vehicles, our living laboratory. We evaluate the state-of-the-art algorithms, search for and address the challenges we found in real-world deployment.

Dynamic interaction with the environment not only includes basic mobility but also the ability to modify the environment through manipulation for assembly, logistics and simple clean-up. The research primarily focuses on task and motion planning for reliable and efficient manipulation actions in dynamic environments for home robots. It includes both basic physical interaction and mobile manipulation.

The backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the robots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this paper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed implementation of a two-stage approach that already exists, where we use the Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation as workhorses to split the computation among the robots. We also provide conditions under which the proposed distributed protocols converge to the solution of the centralized two-stage approach. As a second contribution, we extend the proposed distributed algorithms to work with the object-based map models. The use of object-based models avoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point clouds or RGB-D data) further reducing the communication burden. Our third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo simulations and field experiments in a military test facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed Gauss–Seidel method) has excellent performance. The Distributed Gauss–Seidel method requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a team of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy to implement. Our field tests show that the combined use of our distributed algorithms and object-based models reduces the communication requirements by several orders of magnitude and enables distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world problems.
