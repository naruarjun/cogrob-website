 abstract = {This paper presents a taxonomy of benchmark
manipulation tasks for service robots. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) A review of
relevant literature regarding manipulation tests in
the robotics domain and related fields, such as
physical therapy, assistive technologies and
prosthetics. (2) Guidelines to design useful testing
protocols to evaluate manipulation performance. (3)
A proposed general taxonomy of benchmark
manipulation tasks and sample tests per each class.},
