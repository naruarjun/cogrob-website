abstract: 'This paper presents a taxonomy of benchmark manipulation tasks for service
  robots. Our contributions are threefold: (1) A review of relevant literature regarding
  manipulation tests in the robotics domain and related fields, such as physical therapy,
  assistive technologies and prosthetics. (2) Guidelines to design useful testing
  protocols to evaluate manipulation performance. (3) A proposed general taxonomy
  of benchmark manipulation tasks and sample tests per each class.'
