abstract: "This paper presents a taxonomy of benchmark manipulation tasks for service robots. Our contributions are threefold: (1) A review of relevant literature regarding manipulation tests in the robotics domain and related fields, such as physical therapy, assistive technologies and prosthetics. (2) Guidelines to design useful testing protocols to evaluate manipulation performance. (3) A proposed general taxonomy of benchmark manipulation tasks and sample tests per each class."
