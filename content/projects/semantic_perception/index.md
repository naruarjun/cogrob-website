title: Semantic Perception
summary: A key feature of modern robots operating in human-centric environments is the ability to estimate scene layout, and also associate semantics with scene components, to allow for contextual interaction. Intelligent robots for both in-door and out-door environments, heavily require interpretation of the surrounding to facilitate interaction and planning. We aim to leverage foundational concepts of geometric localization and mapping from classical robotics, along with recent developments in learning-based techniques for retrieving context and scene knowledge, in order to develop smart algorithms for tasks such as semantic scene understanding, mapping, and robot navigation.
